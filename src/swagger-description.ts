Access token is needed to use this API. To get a token, send a POST request with your email address to /api-users (under section "API User") endpoint and one will be sent to your email. Include the token to each request as a Bearer token (http header "Authorization: Bearer \\<ACCESS TOKEN\\>")

Access token, person token and language can be globally configured using the "Authorize" button.
