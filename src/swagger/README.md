 The service is used to patch the OpenAPI document generated by `@nestjs/swagger`. It merges relevant stuff from remote schemas (store, warehouse) to our OpenAPI document.
 
 `@nestjs/swagger` allows patching, but only by a direct non asyncronous call executed outside NestJS scope. That makes the service a bit awkward, and the decorators couldn't be done the way NestJS instructs, as the request isn't in NestJS scope (reflecting NestJS way must access NestJS' "execution context").
